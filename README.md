## 🏆 ACM Ideation Project – Winner (2024)

## Team Unify won the AxiomIVE Ideathon organized by ACM-W CCEW Chapter, Cummins College Pune, under the domain Revolutionary Fintech.

## 🔹 Problem Identified:
Users face difficulty tracking financial transactions across multiple platforms (e.g., UPI apps, credit/debit cards, bank transfers) due to the lack of a centralized tracking system, leading to:

# Scattered financial data

# Poor visibility into spending patterns

# Higher risk of fraud


# 🔹 Our Solution – Unified Transaction System:
We proposed an AI-powered expense tracking app that:

-Consolidates transactions from all sources (UPI, cards, bank) into a single dashboard

-Offers AI-driven insights and smart expense-cutting suggestions

-Prioritizes feasibility, data accuracy via APIs, and startup viability


🎯 This was my first ideation competition, and winning it was an incredible milestone. The experience taught me end-to-end product thinking — from ideation to impactful delivery.
